For the validate binary search tree problem, we used the recursion, backtracking and kind of a 
divide and conquer methodology. We introduce a lower limit and an upper limit value and ensure
that nodes fall in between the upper and lower limits. If by any chance the nodes don't fall in
between, we output a Falsy state, otherwise we output a truthy state.
